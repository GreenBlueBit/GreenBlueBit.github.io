description: The theme for this gamejam was "Spooky baby cultists", an odd one for sure, therefore we followed the 4|44 rule, which I believe was first brought by Rami Ismail, which basically states that you should have a prototype in the first 4 hours of the jam, and if you're happy with it, you continue work for the next 44 hours to polish and perfect it.<br>During these first 4 hours, I focused on quickly creating a prototype which would fit our vision for the game and we managed before the presentation to have a working version of the game, albeit extremely basic with no juice.<br><br>After we were happy with the gameplay, I changed hats to that of a lead programmer and started creating tasks that would be needed to achieve MVP status and then formulate the basics for tasks past that. I then assigned it to my team and continued from there, working both on my tasks and fixing and reviewing theirs wherever needed.<br>We ended up having up to 4 local multiplayer with plenty of scalable functionality for extra items thanks to the design of the inventory system and threats due to the way the possible attacks can be created.
