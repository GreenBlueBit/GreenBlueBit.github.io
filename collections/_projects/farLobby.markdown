description: Develpment of Far Lobby started from the idea that we wanted to make a very simple game, that could be enjoyed in the short time people have to experience games before voting, players not needed to invest more than 5 minutes to enjoy the game to the fullest. <br>My part in this was to first organize the workload based on the capabilities of each person on the coding side. I then looked over all of the tasks and came up with basic designs for each of them, which would ensure a similar approach to the way solutions were developed and make tasks interchangeability between developers easier.<br>
