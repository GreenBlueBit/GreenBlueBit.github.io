description: This year, I finally got to participate in Ludum Dare. My entry was a pretty simple game where you have to manage both the space available to you and your fuel, which is basically a lifeline. You get periodical boosts as the game goes on from Earth and from the colonies you drop on Mars. The development was quite straight forward, I finished it in the first day of the jam, and I spent the rest of the time adding juice and making it work on Android nicely.
