description: I worked on this game as the head programmer, quickly organizing and settling on tasks with the other two programmers. We worked on it using Unity. <br>The game, at it's core, is a local multiplayer king of the hill game with a little bit of arena combat sprinkled in. There is a basic inventory system, giving players the ability to pick up and use items as well as environmental threats from the tentacles that can break in through the stage.<br><br>
