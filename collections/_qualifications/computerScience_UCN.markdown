description: During the top-up, we studied testing in far more detailed than simply unit testing everything blindly. We also focused our attention on the more theoretical aspects of Computer Science, such as Discrete Mathematics and the proper etiquete and practice in writing a Research Paper.<br>The next semester we studied  as well as large scale system development and system integration. These topics were applied in our end of semester project where we developed an application where we not only had to create an application, but design it for scalabaility and for it to be able to function in an agile organization.
